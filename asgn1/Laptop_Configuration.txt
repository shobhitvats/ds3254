2. How would you select a new laptop or PC if you were buying one?
    (Gaming, Graphic designer, Video editing, physics simulation ...)

A. Gaming Laptop/PC

CPU: A 6-core or 8-core processor (Intel Core i7 or i9, AMD Ryzen 7 or 9). A higher 
          clock speed helps with gaming performance, but cores are critical for multitasking and 
          future-proofing.
GPU: A powerful GPU is critical for gaming. Choose a NVIDIA RTX 3060 or higher for good 
          performance at 1080p/1440p. If you're targeting 4K gaming, look at an RTX 3080 or RTX 
          3090.
RAM: 16GB of DDR4 RAM is typically enough for gaming. For heavy multitasking, streaming, or 
           modded games, you might want to go with 32GB.
Storage: At least 512GB SSD for fast load times. Many gamers opt for a 1TB SSD to hold 
                several games, with an additional HDD for storage.
Display: Look for a 144Hz or 240Hz refresh rate for smooth gaming. IPS panels are best for 
               accurate color reproduction.
Cooling: Good cooling is essential for maintaining high performance during long gaming 
                sessions, so choose a laptop with dual fans or a laptop cooler if necessary.


B. Graphic Design or Content Creation

CPU: An Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 will handle creative software like Photoshop, Illustrator, 
          or 3D rendering applications like Blender and Autodesk.
GPU: While a dedicated GPU like the RTX 3060/3070 helps with tasks like 3D modeling, you 
          could also look at NVIDIA Quadro cards for professional design work.
RAM: At least 16GB of RAM, though 32GB is recommended for larger files, 4K video editing, 
           and complex 3D modeling.
Storage: A 1TB SSD is ideal for fast access to your files, and you might want additional HDD or 
                cloud storage for backup.
Display: A 15.6” or 17” IPS display with 100% sRGB or Adobe RGB color accuracy is key for 
               accurate editing.
Other features: Consider extra features like Thunderbolt 3/4 ports for fast data transfer, or a 4K 
                           display for pixel-perfect accuracy.


C. Video Editing and Post-Production

CPU: A multi-core processor (Intel Core i7, i9, or AMD Ryzen 7/9) is critical for handling heavy 
          video editing workflows.
GPU: A GeForce RTX 3060 or higher for rendering and GPU-accelerated editing in software like 
          Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve.
RAM: 32GB of RAM is a good baseline for video editing. More RAM is beneficial for handling 
           large 4K or multi-stream video projects.
Storage: At least a 1TB SSD for your main editing drive, and an additional HDD for storing raw 
                footage.
Display: Preferably a 4K display with high color accuracy (e.g., 100% AdobeRGB or DCI-P3).
Other features: Consider laptops with Thunderbolt 3/4 for faster media transfers, or desktops 
                           with multiple storage options and expansion slots.


D. Physics Simulation or High-Performance Computing

CPU: A high-performance CPU with a high core count (e.g., Intel Xeon or AMD Ryzen 
          Threadripper).
GPU: For simulations using CUDA (e.g., AI/ML or scientific modeling), a powerful NVIDIA RTX 
          3080/3090 or even a Tesla/Quadro series card would be ideal.
RAM: 64GB or more is recommended for handling large datasets.
Storage: A combination of a fast NVMe SSD for OS and software, with a large HDD for data 
                storage.
Cooling: Liquid cooling is often needed for long, high-power computation tasks.
